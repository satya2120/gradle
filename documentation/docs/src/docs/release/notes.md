## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 6.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_6.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

## Configuration cache improvements

TBD - load from cache performance improvements and reduced memory consumption for Android builds

## Support kebab case formatting when launching a Gradle build with abbreviated names

When running Gradle builds, you can abbreviate project and task names. For example, you can execute the `compileTest` task by running `gradle cT`.

Until this release, the name abbreviation only worked for camel case names (e.g. `compileTest`). This format is recommended for task names, but it is unusual for project names. In the Java world the folder names are lower case by convention. 

Many projects - including Gradle - overcome that by using kebab case project directories (e.g. `my-awesome-lib`) and by defining different, camel case project names in the build scripts. This difference leads to unnecessary extra complexity in the build.

This release fixes the issue by adding support for kebab case names in the name matching. Now, you can execute the `compileTest` task in the `my-awesome-lib` subproject with the following command:
```
gradle mAL:cT
```

Note, that even though the kebab case name matching works with tasks too, the recommendation is still to use camel case for them. 

To learn more about name abbreviation, check out the [user guide](userguide/command_line_interface.html#task_name_abbreviation).  

## Gradle init improvements

<-- TBD: add something if we think it is worth mentioning, see #14219 and #14210 -->
