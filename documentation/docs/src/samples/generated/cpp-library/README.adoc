This guide demonstrates how to create a C++ library with Gradle using `gradle init`.
You can follow the guide step-by-step to create a new project from scratch or download the complete sample project using the links above.

== What you’ll build

You'll generate a C++ library that follows Gradle's conventions.

== What you’ll need

* A text editor or IDE - for example link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA]
* A Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher - for example link:https://adoptopenjdk.net/[AdoptOpenJDK]
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or newer
* An installed {cpp} compiler. See which link:{userManualPath}/building_cpp_projects.html#sec:cpp_supported_tool_chain[{cpp} tool chains] are supported by Gradle.

== Create a project folder

Gradle comes with a built-in task, called `init`, that initializes a new Gradle project in an empty folder.
The `init` task uses the (also built-in) `wrapper` task to create a Gradle wrapper script, `gradlew`.

The first step is to create a folder for the new project and change directory into it.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ mkdir demo
$ cd demo
----

== Run the init task

From inside the new project directory, run the `init` task using the following command in a terminal: `gradle init`.
When prompted, select the `3: library` project type and `1: C++` as implementation language.
Next you can choose the DSL for writing buildscripts -  `1  : Groovy` or `2: Kotlin`.
For the other questions, press enter to use the default values.

The output will look like this:

[listing.terminal.sample-command,user-inputs="3|1|1|||"]
----
$ gradle init

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 3

Select implementation language:
  1: C++
  2: Groovy
  3: Java
  4: Kotlin
  5: Scala
  6: Swift
Enter selection (default: Java) [1..6] 1

Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1

Project name (default: demo):

> Task :init

The `init` task generates the new project with the following structure:

<1> Generated folder for wrapper files
<2> Gradle wrapper start scripts
<3> Settings file to define build name and subprojects
<4> Build script of `lib` project
<5> Default C++ source folder
<6> Default C++ test source folder

You now have the project setup to build a C++ library.

== Review the project files

The `settings.gradle(.kts)` file has two active line:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="settings.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[]"]
====
- `rootProject.name` assigns a name to the build, which overrides the default behavior of naming the build after the directory it's in.
  It's recommended to set a fixed name as the folder might change if the project is shared - e.g. as root of a Git repository.
- `include("lib")` defines that the build consists of one subproject called `lib` that contains the actual code and build logic.
  More subprojects can be added by additional `include(...)` statements.

Our build contains one subproject called `lib` that represents the C++ library we are building.
It is configured in the `lib/build.gradle(.kts)` file:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="lib/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="lib/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====
<1> Apply the cpp-library plugin to add support for building C++ libraries
<2> Apply the cpp-unit-test plugin to add support for building and running C++ test executables
<3> Set the target operating system and architecture for this library

The file `src/main/cpp/hello.cpp` is shown here:

.Generated src/main/cpp/hello.cpp
[source,cpp]
----
include::{samples-dir}/groovy/lib/src/main/cpp/hello.cpp[]
----

The generated test, `src/test/cpp/hello.cpp` is shown next:

.Generated src/test/cpp/hello_test.cpp
[source,cpp]
----
$ ./gradlew build
include::{samples-dir}/groovy/lib/src/test/cpp/hello_test.cpp[]
----

The generated test class has a single  test.
The test instantiates the `Hello` class, invokes a method on it, and checks that it returns the expected value.

== Build the library

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew build

include::{samplesPath}/generated/cpp-library/tests/build.out[]
----

NOTE: The first time you run the wrapper script, `gradlew`, there may be a delay while that version of `gradle` is downloaded and stored locally in your `~/.gradle/wrapper/dists` folder.

The `build` task compiles the {cpp} sources, links the object files into a shared library, and runs the tests.
To build a static library, please refer to the https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/cpp/static-library[static library sample].

NOTE: Dependencies on other projects isn't covered in this guide.
To learn more about this subject, have a look at the https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/cpp/transitive-dependencies[transitive dependency sample] for a demonstration.

NOTE: Publishing libraries to Maven repositories is outside the scope of this guide.
To learn more about this subject, have a look at the https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/cpp/simple-library[simple library sample] for a demonstration.

NOTE: Gradle integrates with several IDEs: link:{userManualPath}/visual_studio_plugin.html[Visual Studio], link:{userManualPath}/xcode_plugin.html[Xcode] and https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/gradle-support.html[Clion].
To learn more, have a look at their respective linked documentation to configure those IDE integration in your project.


== Summary

You've learned how to:

* Initialize a project that produces a C++ library
* Build the library, which includes running its tests

== Next Steps

* Make your way to the https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/[native samples repository] to see the C++ plugins in action for common scenarios such as https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/cpp/transitive-dependencies[transitive dependencies], https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/cpp/swift-package-manager[custom source layout], and https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/cpp/static-library[static library].
