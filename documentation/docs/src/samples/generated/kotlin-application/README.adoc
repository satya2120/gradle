This guide demonstrates how to create a Kotlin application with Gradle using `gradle init`.
You can follow the guide step-by-step to create a new project from scratch or download the complete sample project using the links above.

== What you’ll build

You'll generate a Kotlin application that follows Gradle's conventions.

== What you’ll need

* A text editor or IDE - for example link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA]
* A Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher - for example link:https://adoptopenjdk.net/[AdoptOpenJDK]
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or newer


== Create a project folder

Gradle comes with a built-in task, called `init`, that initializes a new Gradle project in an empty folder.
The `init` task uses the (also built-in) `wrapper` task to create a Gradle wrapper script, `gradlew`.

The first step is to create a folder for the new project and change directory into it.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ mkdir demo
$ cd demo
----

== Run the init task

From inside the new project directory, run the `init` task using the following command in a terminal: `gradle init`.
When prompted, select the `2: application` project type and `4: Kotlin` as implementation language.
Next you can choose the DSL for writing buildscripts -  `1  : Groovy` or `2: Kotlin`.
For the other questions, press enter to use the default values.

The output will look like this:

[listing.terminal.sample-command,user-inputs="2|4|1|||"]
----
$ gradle init

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 2

Select implementation language:
  1: C++
  2: Groovy
  3: Java
  4: Kotlin
  5: Scala
  6: Swift
Enter selection (default: Java) [1..6] 4

Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1

Project name (default: demo):
Source package (default: demo):

The `init` task generates the new project with the following structure:

<1> Generated folder for wrapper files
<2> Gradle wrapper start scripts
<3> Settings file to define build name and subprojects
<4> Build script of `app` project
<5> Default Kotlin source folder
<6> Default Kotlin test source folder

You now have the project setup to build a Kotlin application.

== Review the project files

The `settings.gradle(.kts)` file has two active line:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="settings.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[]"]
====
- `rootProject.name` assigns a name to the build, which overrides the default behavior of naming the build after the directory it's in.
  It's recommended to set a fixed name as the folder might change if the project is shared - e.g. as root of a Git repository.
- `include("app")` defines that the build consists of one subproject called `app` that contains the actual code and build logic.
  More subprojects can be added by additional `include(...)` statements.

Our build contains one subproject called `app` that represents the Kotlin application we are building.
It is configured in the `app/build.gradle(.kts)` file:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="app/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="app/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====
<1> Apply the Kotlin JVM plugin to add support for Kotlin.
<2> Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application.
<3> Use JCenter for resolving dependencies.
<4> Align versions of all Kotlin components
<5> Use the Kotlin JDK 8 standard library.
<6> Use the Kotlin test library.
<7> Use the Kotlin JUnit integration.
<8> Define the main class for the application.

The file `src/main/kotlin/demo/App.kt` is shown here:

.Generated src/main/kotlin/demo/App.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{samples-dir}/groovy/app/src/main/kotlin/demo/App.kt[]
----

The generated test, `src/test/kotlin/demo/App.kt` is shown next:

.Generated src/test/kotlin/demo/AppTest.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
$ ./gradlew build
include::{samples-dir}/groovy/app/src/test/kotlin/demo/AppTest.kt[]
----

The generated test class has a single _kotlin.test_ test.
The test instantiates the `App` class, invokes a method on it, and checks that it returns the expected value.

== Run the application

Thanks to the `application` plugin, you can run the application directly from the command line.
The `run` task tells Gradle to execute the `main` method in the class assigned to the `mainClass` property.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew run

> Task :app:run
Hello world.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
----

NOTE: The first time you run the wrapper script, `gradlew`, there may be a delay while that version of `gradle` is downloaded and stored locally in your `~/.gradle/wrapper/dists` folder.

== Bundle the application

The `application` plugin also bundles the application, with all its dependencies, for you.
The archive will also contain a script to start the application with a single command.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew build

include::{samplesPath}/generated/kotlin-application/tests/build.out[]
----

If you run a full build as shown above, Gradle will have produced the archive in two formats for you:
`app/build/distributions/app.tar` and `app/build/distributions/app.zip`.

== Summary

That's it! You've now successfully configured and built a Kotlin application project with Gradle.
You've learned how to:

* Initialize a project that produces a Kotlin application
* Run the build and view the test report
* Execute a Kotlin application using the `run` task from the `application` plugin
* Bundle the application in an archive
